# gshuf is required for this script to work.
# install it with homebbrew by running "brew install coreutils"
# this installs shuf as gshuf.

# This script will check to see what the SSID is of the current WiFi network
# and will compare it to the list at "~/WallAware/UNSAFE_SSIDS.txt"
# if the SSID is found in the list then a random wallpaper is chosen
# from the CLEAN folder, if the SSID is not found then a random wallpaper
# will be chosen from the DIRTY folder.

# If either the CLEAN or DIRTY folders are left empty then when switching
# to that status the wallpaper will revert to the last wallpaper set
# using system Preferences. This can be useful if you want to set the DIRTY
# wallpapers but switch back to the default dynamic wallpaper that ships switch
# macOS for the CLEAN status...or vise versa I suppose.
